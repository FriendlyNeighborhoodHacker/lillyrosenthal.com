/**
 * Uptime check for external monitors (HetrixTools, a cron curl, ...).
 *
 * Proves the whole request path works: DNS -> Apache -> PHP -> the web root
 * holding a finished Astro build. Point the monitor at
 *   https://lillyrosenthal.org/uptime.php
 * and have it alert on anything other than HTTP 200 or a body that does not
 * start with "success".
 *
 * Responses (text/plain, never cached):
 *   200  success : 2026-11-05 14:03:21 EST
 *   503  failure : 2026-11-05 14:03:21 EST : <what went wrong>
 *
 * The site is static and has no database, so the only thing that can be wrong
 * on the server side is the deploy itself: scripts/deploy.sh swaps the whole
 * web root for a fresh dist/, and a build that died halfway, or a web root that
 * was never populated, leaves no (or a truncated) index.html. That is what
 * this checks. Video comes from the Cloudflare bucket and is not probed here;
 * a monitor on that origin belongs on its own hostname.
